                    Acromage is deceptively simple. You start out with five cards and a set amount of resources and
                    resource
                    producers (sources), along with a tower and wall. The goal is to fulfill one of three conditions: To
                    reduce your opponent's tower to zero or build your tower to the limit 100. Conversely, you lose if
                    your
                    tower is reduced to zero or you let your opponent's tower get too high.
                </div>
                <div class="rules_paragraph">
                    The turn order is simple: first you draw up to five cards (your first turn), collect resources equal
                    to
                    how many producers (sources) you have (If you have five mines for example, you get five bricks this
                    turn) and then choose a card to play (left-click on card area) or discard (left-click on discard
                    area).
                    You can only play or discard one card on your turn (unless you play a card that allows
                    you to play again), of which you will again draw back up to five. At any one time, you'll have a
                    hand of
                    five cards.
                </div>
                <div class="rules_paragraph">
                    There are three types of cards: Orange cards use bricks, which are produced by mines. They generally
                    work on your wall. Blue cards use gems, which are produced by magic. They generally concern the
                    construction of your tower. Green cards use beasts, which are produced by dungeons. They generally
                    work
                    as your offense. There are exceptions of course, but this is the general rule.
                </div>
                <div class="rules_paragraph">
                    When attacking your enemy (using a card that inflicts damage), any damage will be dealt to their
                    wall
                    first. If any damage is left over, the remainder will be inflicted onto their tower. Thus the wall
                    works
                    as a protective shield for your tower. Of course, there are ways around it, with cards (usually
                    blue)
                    that inflict direct damage on a tower.
